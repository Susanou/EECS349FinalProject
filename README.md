## Install required imports
Using python 3.6 pip package you can install all packages using the following command in the current directory

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If the previous command uses pip for python2.7 use the `pip3` command. Otherwise you can force pip to use a certain version of python using the following command

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
